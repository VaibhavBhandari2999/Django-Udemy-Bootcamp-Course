So jQuery is a JS library that is a large single .js file that has many pre-built methods and objects that simplify your workflow.
Specifically interacting with the DOM and making HTTPS requests (AJAX).

When jQuery was created, the more robust and convenient methods such as .querySelector() didn't exist.
jQuery was created as a way to help simplify interactions with the DOM.
One of its main features is the use of the $ su=ign.

To get jQuery we have 2 options:
	Link a CDN hosted file (like we did for bootstrap)
	Download the .js file form jQuery's official website

Once we've done this and connected jQuery using the <script> tags, we can use the specialized jQuery calls to interact with the DOM.

So, in Jquery instead of using the:
		var divs=document.querySelectorAll('div');
	We can use:
		var divs=$('div');	

This gives the same result and saves a list of all the div elements in the div variable.

When we want to change the styling of the tags, in JS we do:
	el.style.borderWidth='20px';
In jQuery, we do:
	$(el).css('border-width','20px');

So we can see that jQuery lets us change any CSS property very easily

Another example relating to function calls:
	jQuery:
		$(document).ready(function(){ //code });
	JS:
		function ready(fn) {
			if (document.readyState != 'loading'){
				fn();
			} 
			else {
				document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fn);
			}
