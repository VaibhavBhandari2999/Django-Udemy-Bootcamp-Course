3 parts of the border property for DIVs, border-color, border-width(like thin, thick, 2px), bordor-style(like dotted)

IDs must be unique, classes not compulsory

So HTML tags can have class="XYZ" or/and id="ABC" 

When you want to give styling to all divs or paragraphs in a page
div{
}
p{
}

When you want to give styling to a class, you do it by telling CSS its a class by adding a dot before it
.XYZ{
}

When you want to give styling to an id, you do it by telling CSS its an id by adding a # before it
#ABC{
}

* is used to select every element on the page

See CSS Selectors in W3Schools

Eg->
h3+ul{
}		which is basically for all unordered lists which occur immediately after a h3

li a{
}		which is basically for all anchor tags inside a list

li a[href="www.npr.org"]{
}		which is basically for all anchor tags with that href inside a list


Specificity defines the heirarchy of CSS styling, and what types of tags overrule others
Eg->	<li class="topitems">First</li>
	<li id="two" class="topitems">Second</li>
	<li>Third</li>
	<li>Fourth</li>

Initially, if we do:
li{	color:red;
}
All the list items becomes red.

Then, if we add another styling(class) to the li:
.topitems{	color:blue;
}
The first 2 list items have become blue, 3rd and 4th are still red.

Then, if we add another styling(id) to the li:
#two{	border:3px solid black;
}
The 2nd list item now has a border and is blue, 1st one is just blue, 3rd and 4th are red.

-------We wont use this often, because we will use BootStrap instead.

If we want to change color of link once we've clicked on it, we can use a:visited{color:"blue";}
