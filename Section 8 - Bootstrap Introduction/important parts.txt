Bootstrap is a common framework used for front end development. Its going to save a lot of time from dealing with CSS manually.
What is a framework? What makes it different from a library or a package?
Ans->	Framework has Inversion of Control		Which means the framework is defining the rules for you to follow
		      Default Behaviour
		      Extensibility
		      Non-modifiable framework code

A large part of bootstrap is understanding how to reference the documentation for your own cases.

Bootstrap v4 is a major rewrite from Bootstrap v3, but we won't delve deep enough to notice many of the differences.
The major differences are:
	Panels are being replaced by cards
	Larger default font sizes
	New grid tier(XL)
	Use of flexbox
	Moves from LESS(Leaner CSS) to SASS(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)

The Documentation for bootstrap is really good and is found at getbootstrap.com
There are 2 ways to use Bootstrap:
	1) Download the source code (Font files, JS files, source LESS)
	2) Use the CDN(Contect Delivery Network) where we use the <link> tag to use the files over the internet.


There are multiple templates and examples also found on the site like Jumbotrons, Navbars, Links

So its basically a bunch of predefined CSS files which we can use which have their own classes predefined
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A key feature of bootstrap is its default classes.

To use bootstrap, add the CDN <link> under the <head> area of the HTML file.
Note- Bootstrap has a different default font to HTML

See the bootstrap button classes at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/

For buttons, put the classes as class="btn btn-success btn-lg"
You can put buttons as disabled also


For jumbotron, see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/
Jumbotron is a lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages 
on your site.
Normally the jumbotron is inside a container class.
