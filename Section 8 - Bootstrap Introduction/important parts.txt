Bootstrap is a common framework used for front end development. Its going to save a lot of time from dealing with CSS manually.
What is a framework? What makes it different from a library or a package?
Ans->	Framework has Inversion of Control		Which means the framework is defining the rules for you to follow
		      Default Behaviour
		      Extensibility
		      Non-modifiable framework code

A large part of bootstrap is understanding how to reference the documentation for your own cases.

Bootstrap v4 is a major rewrite from Bootstrap v3, but we won't delve deep enough to notice many of the differences.
The major differences are:
	Panels are being replaced by cards
	Larger default font sizes
	New grid tier(XL)
	Use of flexbox
	Moves from LESS(Leaner CSS) to SASS(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)

The Documentation for bootstrap is really good and is found at getbootstrap.com
There are 2 ways to use Bootstrap:
	1) Download the source code (Font files, JS files, source LESS)
	2) Use the CDN(Contect Delivery Network) where we use the <link> tag to use the files over the internet.


There are multiple templates and examples also found on the site like Jumbotrons, Navbars, Links

So its basically a bunch of predefined CSS files which we can use which have their own classes predefined
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A key feature of bootstrap is its default classes.

To use bootstrap, add the CDN <link> under the <head> area of the HTML file.
Note- Bootstrap has a different default font to HTML

See the bootstrap button classes at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/

For buttons, put the classes as class="btn btn-success btn-lg"
You can put buttons as disabled also


For jumbotron, see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/
Jumbotron is a lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages 
on your site.
Normally the jumbotron is inside a container class.

Bootstrap comes with many default classes for forms.
See it at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/ OR https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#forms
Something we'll do very often in bootstrap is to get everything in a container class.

One example is the class form-group which we put in the style parameter of all divs inside a form. This makes the form centered and 
look nicerwith spacing
<form>
	<div style="form-group">
		<input type="".....>
	</div>
</form>

There's another class called form-control class which rounds the corners, stretches the input accordingly, stuff like that, there's a
halo around the input box when the mouse is on it, when drop-downs are being used, bootstrap makes them look better
The form control class is used in the <input> tags in a form

We can also use form-text text-muted to write stuff like "We'll never use your info for any wrong purposes" under an input box.

Note-> See multiple class in the select tag of the form

There also classes called from-control-file, 
form-check-disabled(used when you want to show a radio button as greyed out or disabled), 
form-check-label(used for labels of radio buttons), 
form-check(used for radio buttons),
form-check-input

<legend> tag adds an underline under a heading or some 

You can find all these form examples on https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/
