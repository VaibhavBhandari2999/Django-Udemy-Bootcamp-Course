Sometime all fonts aren't available on a certain OS so we need to provide web links to that font
h1{
	font-family:cursive or "Arial" or monospace
	font-style:italic;
	font-weight:bold;
	font-size:20px;					//Or we can use EM values instead of pixels, EM values is a dynamic way of
								naming things. EM is equal to the size of the font applying to the 
								parent of the element in question. Browser default(is you haven't 
								specified font size anywhere) is 16px. So by default 1em=16px
								So, now if we write 2em , we get 32 px
							But usually we select a font size for the body element. So the other elements
							for which you've specified font size will be in terms of em, where 1em=
							font size defined in the body element
}

There are other properties like text-align, text-shadow, text-decoration etc.

Fonts for each OS can be found in these wikipedia pages-> 
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces_included_with_Microsoft_Windows
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typefaces_included_with_macOS

For font availibility on both platforms, see https://www.cssfontstack.com/

Two websites to download fonts from is fonts.google.com and fontlibrary.org

On fonts.google.com, click on the style you want, click on 'select this style'. 2 codes will pop up, one for <link> and one for
@import statement. It also specifies CSS rules to specify the families. You've to add the rules in the CSS file of your project.

On fontlibrary.org, we can click on the font we want, on the left we get the <link> and @import statements along with the code to put
in the CSS file.

We've to save the <link> in the <head> area of the HTML file. 
We've to save the CSS font-family rules into the div or span or a you want to add the font to.


NOTES:-
1)	If there are multiple fonts in the font-family property, thats so that there is always a "fallback" system (ie, if a browser 
	doesn't
	support a type of font, it tries the next font). 
	<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">
	</span>

2)	If we use a font only available on my computer(not through the internet), when we open the website in another computer, the 
	default font for that computer will be used.

3)	For inherit keyword, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit

4)	Difference between <link> and @import is that <link> is the HTML mechanism to include a stylesheet while @import is the CSS
	mechanism to use a stylesheet.
	<link> is better and prefered by developers.
	The <link> directive can allow for multiple css be loaded and interpreted asyncronously.
	The @import directive forces the browser* to wait until the imported script is loaded inline to the parent script before it 
	can be correctly processed by it's engine, since technically it is just one script.
	
	One main advantage of using <link> is that it provides alternate stylesheets for the website(rel="alternate stylesheet").
